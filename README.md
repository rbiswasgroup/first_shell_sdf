# First Shell Spatial Density Calculator

This tool computes the **3D spatial density function (SDF)** of atoms from selected residue types that lie within a **first solvation shell cutoff** around a specified atom from a GROMACS trajectory. It outputs:

* A `.dx` volumetric density map (OpenDX format) centered on the reference atom.
* A `.pdb` file with the reference atom at the origin for visualization.

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/)
* `numpy`
* `tqdm`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install MDAnalysis numpy tqdm
```
---
## Installation
You can install it by:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/rbiswasgroup/first_shell_sdf.git
```
---
Or after extracting the zip file, inside the folder, just execute
```bash
pip install .
```
---

## üì• Input Files

* `topol.tpr`: GROMACS topology file
* `traj.xtc`: GROMACS trajectory (see preprocessing section below)
* Atom index (GROMACS-style, 1-based)
* Residue names to include in the shell (e.g., `SOL`, `MLT`, `CHL`)
* Shell cutoff distance (in √Ö)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
firstshellsdf -t topol.tpr -x traj_fitted.xtc -i 4201 -c 3.5 -r SOL MLT CHL
```

### Optional flags:

* `--spacing`: Grid spacing in √Ö (default = `0.5`)

### Full command-line help:

```bash
usage: firstshellsdf [-t TPR] [-x XTC] [-i INDEX] [-c CUTOFF] [-r RESNAMES [RESNAMES ...]] [--spacing SPACING]

Compute spatial density of first-shell atoms around a given atom.

optional arguments:
  -t, --tpr       Input .tpr file
  -x, --xtc       Input .xtc trajectory
  -i, --index     GROMACS atom index (1-based)
  -c, --cutoff    First shell cutoff distance (in √Ö)
  -r, --resnames  Residue names to include (e.g., SOL MLT CHL)
  --spacing       Grid spacing (default: 0.5 √Ö)
```

## üîÑ Preprocessing the Trajectory

The `.xtc` input should be centered and fitted to remove translational motion of the chosen atom. To prepare your trajectory:

1. **Make an index file (`index.ndx`)** with the atom of interest (e.g. atom 4201):

   ```
   [ selected_atom ]
   4201
   ```

2. **Center the trajectory:**

   ```bash
   gmx trjconv -s topol.tpr -f traj.xtc -o traj_centered.xtc \
       -n index.ndx -boxcenter tric -center -ur compact -pbc none -skip 10
   ```

3. **Fit to remove translational motion:**

   ```bash
   gmx trjconv -s topol.tpr -f traj_centered.xtc -o traj_fitted.xtc \
       -fit trans -n index.ndx
   ```

4. **Use `traj_fitted.xtc` as the input to this script.**

---

## üì§ Outputs

* `sdf_<index>_<resnames>.dx`: Spatial density map centered on the reference atom
* `center_atom_<index>.pdb`: Reference atom placed at origin (for alignment)

---

## üñº Visualization

1. Load `.dx` into **VMD**, **ChimeraX**, or **PyMOL** as a volumetric map.
2. Load `.pdb` as a VDW sphere.
3. Set isosurfaces or transparency to visualize shell distribution.
